# User testing ✍

### After we made our prototype, we had to go out to the streets and show the people our app.
### [This is our design](https://www.figma.com/file/KnLqYIvShOkk3cnVPFAAdOdy/Untitled?node-id=0%3A1).

## Some slides from our prototype:

* We went out to the Nazareth streets.

## First tester opinion:
> I hope you make it in Arabic so we can understand it.
  I can't understand what is written.
  Nice idea I like the idea, I have no knowledge about your topic but I guess it will help the community.
  Good luck guys.

## Second tester opinion:
> Ask more questions for the guy who want to donate, he might suffer from things that makes him not allowed to donate,
  so you can make it easier and not to waste their time. Good luck.
  
## Third tester opinion: 
> I like the idea, I'm glad there is people like you guys.
  I would suggest to make it show results of the closest stations to make it easier.
  
## Fourth tester opinion:
> Nice idea guys, I liked it. Sorry I have no time. Good luck guys.
